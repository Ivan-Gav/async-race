# Async race

This project was done as part of [RS School JS Frontend course](https://rs.school/js/).
The topic of the project is **client - server interaction**.
If you're interested, here is the [link](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/async-race.md) to the detailed description of the task.

The working app is deployed [here](https://ivan-gav.github.io/async-race/) but to enjoy the game you'll going to have to start the server for it following [these instructions](https://github.com/mikhama/async-race-api). 

Technology stack:
- TypeScript
- HTML/CSS
- Webpack
- ESlint + Prettier

The application is SPA. All the HTML-content is generated by JavaScript (body contains only one tag script inside).

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
